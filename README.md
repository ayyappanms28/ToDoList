# ToDoList

The To-Do List application is a tool designed to help users organize their tasks and track their progress. Users can easily add items to their to-do lists, specifying the tasks they need to complete. Once a task is finished, they can check it off to mark it as completed. Additionally, users have the option to remove items from their lists if they no longer need to complete them. This application provides a simple and efficient way for users to manage their tasks and stay organized in their daily lives.
